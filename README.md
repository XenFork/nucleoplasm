## nucleoplasm json edit
    This mod aims to modify the Recipe<?> class recipe with JSON, which belongs to the category of magic modification.
    This is an independent mod attached to the core mod. It does not need to be added to the API separately. Currently, it can only be downloaded from the author's maven repository, and will be downloaded from the mcmod encyclopedia later.
    The method of use is also very simple. When it is first generated, a JSON folder will be generated in the server directory or MC directory. The JSON folder will have an edit folder. The naming rules in the folder are:
    A folder containing the name of the mod. It can also be your custom English name
    Subordinate file -> .json file with English name
    Chinese folders and Chinese names are currently not supported.
